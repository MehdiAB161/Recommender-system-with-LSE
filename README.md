Recommender algorithm using the MovieLens data to estimate the ratings

The algorithm reads the data from the database file, which you can download from the MovieLens website.

It calculates the U and V matrixes then calculates the RMSE.

You can change the parameters at the beginning of the code to test the effect on the prediction.

The best score I obtained was 0.85, using the 1M data.
